# Tuples is list of values joined together
# Different values of the tuples has different meaning, but in a list all element should have same meaning and type , example of list can be expenses of person
# Example of Tuples is a "point" in a plane, point(5,6), here 5 denotes x coordinate and 6 denotes y coordinate

point=(5,6)
# to get a element from the tuple
print(point[0], point[1]) 

# other example of tuple is address , here two elements are String and one is Number, we cannot store different types of element in one list but in tuples it is possible

address=("Near Brilliant Academy","Ranipur","Darbhanga",846005)
print(address)

# Last points about the tuples is tuples are immutable, you cannot change values of tuple but Lists are muttable, you can change amy elements of list
